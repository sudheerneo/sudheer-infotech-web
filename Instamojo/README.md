## How to install

Just open ```config.php``` file.

```php
<?php

	$email = 'YOUR_EMAIL'; //To Sent to a notify email whenever a user complete a payment.
	$api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
	$api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET';
	$api_salt = 'YOUR_API_SALT';
	$webhook_url = 'https://YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/webhook.php';
	$redirect_url = 'https://YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/thanks.php';
	$mode = "test"; //You can change it to live by just replacing it by 'live'
	if($mode == 'live'){
		$mode = 'www';
	}else{
		$mode = 'test';
	}
    
?>
```

Edit and Replace ```YOUR_EMAIL``` with your email & replace ```API_KEY , API_SECRET AND API_SALT ``` with your own credentials which you can obtain from instamojo dashboard.

And in last edit ```YOUR_WEBSITE_URL``` with your website url and if the instamojo files are in sub-directory then add ```YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/DIRECTORY_NAME/```

NOTE - ```test.instamojo.com``` and ```instamojo.com``` are both different site, the one with subdomain test is only for testing purposes and the ```API_KEY, API_SECRET, & API_SALT``` is different for both the sites.

So if you are planning to use this script in live mode just edit ```$mode = 'test';```  adn replace ```test``` with ```live```
